  LSI SAS 9201-16i PCI ExpressÂ® to 6Gb/s SAS Host Bus Adapter
  NOTE: From page 2:
        Connect SAS cables between the HBA and the SAS backplane
        that contains any other SATA or SAS devices.  The
        LSISAS9201-16i has four internal x4 mini-SAS connectors,
        each connecting to four 6Gb/s SAS ports. Use the
        appropriate cable to connect the HBA to SAS or SATA
        storage devices.

        For connection to internal drives or backplanes, use an
        internal cable with a standard mini-SAS connector
        (SFF-8087) on the controller side of the cable.  The
        other end of the cable may fan out into four SAS-style
        cables for direct connection to SAS or SATA disk drives.
        The previous figure shows the connector locations on the
        LSISAS9201-16i and the use of a controller-based, fan-out
        cable to connect to drives that require a SAS-style signal
        connector.
