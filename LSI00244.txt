LSI00244 (9201-16i) PCI-Express 2.0 x8 16Port 6Gb/s SATA/SAS controller card


"SAS2 - An additional option is the LSI SAS 9201, a 16-port card which
uses the LSI SAS2116 controller, which is also known to work well and
only supports HBA usage, not hardware RAID. It is not very popular
because it is more expensive than a pair of 8-port HBAs."

Cabling
=======
6. Connect SAS cables between the HBA and the SAS backplane
that contains any other SATA or SAS devices.  The
LSISAS9201-16i has four internal x4 mini-SAS connectors,
each connecting to four 6Gb/s SAS ports. Use the
appropriate cable to connect the HBA to SAS or SATA
storage devices.

For connection to internal drives or backplanes, use an
internal cable with a standard mini-SAS connector
(SFF-8087) on the controller side of the cable.  The
other end of the cable may fan out into four SAS-style
cables for direct connection to SAS or SATA disk drives.
The previous figure shows the connector locations on the
LSISAS9201-16i and the use of a controller-based, fan-out
cable to connect to drives that require a SAS-style signal
connector.
